		<h2>About Vector</h2>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>
			Vector is a modern and simplistic approach to the playing and management of scavenger hunt games for a wide array of people.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Audience</h3>
		<br>
		<p>
			Vector will be targeted at organizations or groups who host outdoor or party activities for leisure or fundraising purposes.
		</p>
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<br>
		<p>
			To increase the ease in organizing scavenger hunt games by providing a platform that will allow for users to quickly create and participate in large scale scavenger hunt games, 
			without the need to physically place objects at target positions. 
		</p>
		<h3>How it works</h3>
		<br>
		<p>
		A user can either be a player or the creator of a game. The creator is able to set the details of the game including: the name, start and end times,
		the location and details of clues. The player is able to search and play games. After a game has ended, 
		the winner of the game will be determined as either the player in the game with the highest score or the first player to achieve the maximum score.
