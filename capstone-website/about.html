				<h2>About Vector</h2>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>
					Vector is a modern and simplistic approach to the playing and management of scavenger hunt games for a wide array of people.
				</p>
				<p>
					The main objective of Vector is to transition the traditional methods of playing scavenger hunt games into a new and awesome way for everyone.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Audience</h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					Vector will be targeted at organizations or groups who host outdoor or party activities for leisure or fundraising purposes.
				</p>
				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					To increase the ease in organizing scavenger hunt games by providing a platform that will allow for users to quickly create and participate in large scale scavenger hunt games,
					without the need to physically place objects at target positions.
				</p>
				<h3>How it works</h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					After you download our application, you can sign up for an account to start playing!
				</p>

				<br>
				<p>
					Once you've signed up, you can either login as a player or as a creator in the system.
				</p>
				<h4>As a Creator</h4>
				<p>
					The creator is able to start a game with the details of the game including: the name, start and end times, description.
				</p>

				<br>
				<p>
					The creator will now make clues for the game that was made which will use a question, hint, answer and location in coordinates.
				</p>
				<img src="images/clues.png" style="max-width:50%; max-height:50%; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;">
				<br>
				<p>
					After this easy setup, the game is published and ready for players to join.
				</p>
				<h4>As a Player</h4>
				<p>
					The player is able to search and join games to play them and compete against other players in those games.
				</p>
				<img src="images/joingame.png" style="max-width:50%; max-height:50%; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;">
				<br>
				<p>
					The player will run around the game area and when they are near a clue, a question will be shown on the screen to solve. Solving the question correcting claims the clue for that player.
				</p>
				<img src="images/cluefound.png" style="max-width:50%; max-height:50%; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;">
				<br>
				<p>
					After a game has ended, the winner of the game will be determined as either the player in the game with the highest score or the first player to achieve the maximum score.
